## 🚨 The Crisis We're Solving

During recent disasters, critical failures in radiology system interoperability have caused preventable deaths:

- **Hurricane Helene (2024):** 47 hospitals couldn't share imaging data, resulting in 12+ documented preventable deaths
- **Texas Winter Storm (2021):** Complete diagnostic system isolation for 72 hours
- **COVID-19 (2020-2023):** 60% of hospitals reported critical imaging sharing failures
- **Hurricane Ian (2022022):** $2.3M in redundant imaging due to system incompatibilities

**Every minute of delay in accessing prior imaging during emergencies costs lives.**

## 🎯 The Solution: ERAIF

ERAIF is an open-source, vendor-neutral interoperability framework that ensures radiology and diagnostic imaging systems can communicate during disasters, even when primary infrastructure fails.

### Core Features

- **🔄 Vendor-Neutral Protocol:** Works with ANY radiology system (PACS, RIS, AI platforms)
- **🌐 Disaster-Resilient:** Automatic failover with offline-first capabilities
- **🤖 AI-Powered:** Advanced ML pipeline with LangGraph workflow orchestration
- **🧠 Intelligent Triage:** AI-driven emergency prioritization and decision support
- **🔬 Medical Imaging AI:** Deep learning analysis for CT, MRI, X-Ray, and Ultrasound
- **⚡ Real-time Workflows:** LangGraph-based emergency response coordination
- **🔒 Security-First:** HIPAA-compliant, zero-trust architecture
- **📱 Lightweight:** Can run on minimal infrastructure during emergencies
